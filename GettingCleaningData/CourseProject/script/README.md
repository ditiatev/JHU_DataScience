# README

All code included in one single file named "run_ananlysis.R".

You should download data set into a working directory in folder "./data" and unzip files. [Link for row data sets](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

The final way for unzipping files should be like "./data/UCI HAR Dataset/" or you can change the working directory in script file.

Run script "run_ananlysis.R" and you will get the result into auto-created folder "./output/smartphone_human_act_means.txt".
